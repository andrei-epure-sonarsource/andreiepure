This is my private account. You can see what I do at Sonar here: [@andrei-epure-sonarsource](https://github.com/andrei-epure-sonarsource).

TL;DR: I work for the Languages Team @ Sonar. We develop the code analyzers that power our awesome products:
- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) - on-prem analysis (has a free Community edition)
- [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) - SaaS (free for open-source)
- [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) - IDE plugins, free for everyone :smile: 

These tools are used by millions of developers and tens of thousands of organizations use to deliver cleaner, more secure code.

Previously, I wrote software at Microsoft Ireland, empowering customers to buy and manage their Office 365 subscriptions. I also worked for Bitdefender and for Almetis.
